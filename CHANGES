20171228 Fixed dictionary creation. Given f::{[d];d:::{};{d,x,x}'x;d},
20171228 f(!2);f(!1) should be :{[0 0]}. Was :{[0 0] [1 1]} due to in-situ
20171228 modification of dictionary literal. Oops.
20171226 Allowed a:=b to grow "a", if both "a" and "b" are strings, i.e.
20171226 "abx":="cde",2 --> "abcde".

20171125 and projection works everywhere, for example: rndn(;3)'x or even
20171125 (!3){x+y+z}(;5;)!3. The new grammar extends the previous one, so all
20171125 existing program should still work. See the Klong reference manual
